        <h3>A twenty-five minute release in six parts, by Trigger&nbsp;Man</h3>
        <p>
          The music included on this release was written between
          November of 2009 and March of 2011. The release itself
          was published on August 11th, 2012.

        <h4>
          The songs are divided into two groups
        </h4>
        <p>
          The first three tracks stand individually. “Too Nice”
          ponders the balance between aspiration and aggression.
          “Amenities, Extremities” explores the convergence of
          time, focus, work, leisure, and indulgence. “Blunt Trauma”
          stresses the importance learning and acknowledges
          the embarassment over past mistakes. The remaining three compose
          a&nbsp;unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Lights Out In Circle City” is the exposition of a story.
          It describes a domed police state whose inhabitants are convinced
          into thinking they lead comfortable lives. In their defense,
          they don’t know any better; any attempts at enlightenment
          or escape are thwarted by the law. Nonetheless, the hope
          for a better life still shines within some.
        </p>
        <p>
          “A Charge Out in the Fusebox” introduces two central characters.
          The first is a petty outlaw who, due to his desire to escape
          <i>Circle City</i>, is under hot pursuit. The second has enjoyed
          a life of aristocracy, above the regulations that burden the rest
          of her neighbors. She knows the truth, but is conflicted by its
          incriminating nature in the minds of others. To her, life in
          the city is too grim, and she feels too powerless. Fearing her
          existence has lost its meaning, she sees the outlaw’s attempts at
          escape and decides to help him.
        </p>
        <p>
          With her knowledge of <i>Circle City's</i> secrets, she uses a device
          called <i>a fusebox</i> to temporarily shut down the city’s power
          supply. This throws the docile city into chaos. With the police
          distracted, she leads the outlaw to the outside world. He falls
          in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little did the outlaw know, he was hoping for passage into a forsaken
          desert. Immediately thrown into fear and confusion, he resents his
          rescuer for leading him to certain death. (He is also upset
          about getting shut down when he puts the moves on her.) She reminds
          him that a return to the city would lead to the same fate for
          both of them. She gave him what exactly what he wanted,
          he just had no idea what he was asking for.

        <h4>About the presentation</h4>
        <p>
          The digital age of music has brought its share of innovations.
          These are balanced with some drawbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          On vinyl LPs, before the age of Google and Wikipedia, an album’s
          liner notes were the main source of information surrounding its
          release. They represented a gateway into the musicians’ minds;
          a peek into their world. They were akin to the program notes
          of classical tradition, not considered riff-raff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have iPods, playlists, and digital streaming,
          owning a physical copy of a release is unimportant to most listeners.
          Delving deeper into the lyrics of any given album is difficult, and
          usually the journey ends on a painful, ad-ridden lyric site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital release of <i>Lights Out in Circle City</i> seeks
          to distill the album to its elements: art, song, and lyric.
          We believe it is possible to use web technologies to showcase
          them in a substantial way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sincerely hope you enjoy this presentation.
