"Where are we?"
"Outside of those walls that held us for so long!"
We're thirsty, you told me,
You're equally powerless.

Heat saps your life, but when it rained,
You were flowing.
Maybe I can have a chance to show you
I'm worth something.

Wandering and wondering…
I feel your eyes, how they criticize!
You've led me out and you've led me on–
I've reasoned I'm not the only one.

"I did this to you, I knew I had to…
You're such a naïve little boy…"
Forging my faces, I'm caught in the paces
Erasing myself from a moment with you.
You're lucky the stakes are so high in this game,
I just don't want to play anymore.

Misfired synapse!
Falter!

Wandering and wondering…
I feel your eyes, how they criticize!
You've led me out and you've led me on–
I've reasoned I'm not the only one.

I'm in this with you, I know I have to.
We could walk for days, but we're done running away.
I'm in this with you, I know I have to.
We could walk for days, but we're done running away.
I'm in this with you, I know I have to.
We could walk for days, but we're done running away.
I'm in this with you, I know I have to.
We could walk for days, but we're done running away.

Melting away, you're melting away.
Forging my faces, I'm caught in the paces
Erasing myself from a moment with you.
You're lucky the stakes are so high in this game,
I just don't want to–

Wandering and wondering…

You've led me out and you've led me on–
I've reasoned I'm not the only one.
