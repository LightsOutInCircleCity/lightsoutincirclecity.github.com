"Run kid, run!"
The store clerk shouts after him
As he bolts out of the front door.
She awaits the sun,
Arm on ice on a windowsill,
Cold as the hands that are strangling the guns.
Eye to eye thanks to "WALK" signals…

Three steps, he turns,
And falters aside–
The girl in the alleyway's altered his flight.
"You can't get away,
Least not this way you can't!"
So he followed her words and her shape in the dark.
Numbers slow the enemy…

"Well I'm taking you down to where I'll hide you,"
Weighted words, her weighted dread
"Do you really want to/do you even know how to?"
Situations pin this man!

Now the sirens are submerged…
And she opens the door…
And she brings out a fusebox.
What is this device for?

Lights off one by one!
Spread inversion over everyone!
Chaos reigns for days!
'Til the heralds say that the sun is just a game.

After an hour the pair walks out.
His captors are gone…

"I'm taking you down to where I'll hide you,"
Weighted words, her weighted dread
"Do you really want to/do you even know how to?"
Situations pin this man!
