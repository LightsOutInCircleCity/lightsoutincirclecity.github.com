I want to get some shut-eye, but I can't stop this twitch
Glaring at the room's side; that's not gonna soothe my itch!
But now I tread the inside, a nightly march in a backlit glow,
Eluding me with enzymes; and I just can't help thinking about it!

Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?
Cause when your blood starts pumping then you better be ready to go.
Why does your time have effect on me?
When are you gonna take control?!

Now it's so far away, skating the sawtooth horizon.
Masted fabrics spherize; I'm captive by the wind!
The sea matches the sky. Will I find the light again?
Am I chasing night life, or am I chasing sin?

Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?
Cause when your blood starts pumping then you better be ready to go.
Why does your time have effect on me?
When are you gonna take–
When are you gonna take control?!

What say you when I find out I'm upside-down?
Can't we just see eye-to-eye?
I'm pleased to see the fate we're sharing here.
Now if only I could touch you to know you're real…

Woah, do your arms shake behind the bow?
Cause when your blood starts pumping then you better be ready to go.
Why does your time have effect on me?
When are you gonna take control?!
