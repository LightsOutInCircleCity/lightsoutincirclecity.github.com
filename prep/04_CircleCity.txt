I ask how long the sleepers
Have called this home.
Where word beyond the lip
Escapes the owned.
What is life like on the outside
These walls we've known?

Well if you like to breathe,
You can breathe in my city and
Taste the air of comfort.
You should listen to me.
You should pay me your attention.
If you don't you might be crazy…
Then we'd just have to take you there anyway.

Take you, they break you,
They work to divide you.
The outside is out there.
This circle can't stop you.

Set a reference: bevels in the snow.
Closing in now? Unknown.
Run where the foxes die!
Scratching leather; glacial air is cursed,
Crystallizing my eyes…
Run where the foxes die!

These walls are watching!
These walls are watching!
These walls are watching!
These walls are watching!

Set a reference: bevels in the snow.
Closing in now? Unknown.
Run where the foxes die!
Scratching leather; glacial air is cursed,
Crystallizing my eyes…
Run where the foxes die!
Run where the foxes die!
Run where the foxes die!
