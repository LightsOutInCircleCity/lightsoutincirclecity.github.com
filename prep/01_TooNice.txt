Can you wrap your fingers around the wall?
Watch you send your letters through lines of code.
Did the income set? Did the check make it into my account?
What you've got is everything you have left.

Well, it takes too much resolve to keep a straight face.
I'm the worst at managing arguments.
Do you even care? Do you even realize you have effect?
If you want me to feed you, I give you my defense:

Can't you see I've won? Can't you see I've won?
Can't you see I've won? Woah, woah…
I'm not too nice!

Tumbling back, we all end right where we began,
But so much worse. If we could only go back in time.
Live more. Speed up. Pass me by.
Taunt me. Chase me 'til I die.

Can't you see I've won? Can't you see I've won?
Can't you see I've won? Woah, woah…
I'm not too nice!
