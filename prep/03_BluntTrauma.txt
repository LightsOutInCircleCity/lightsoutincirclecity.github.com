Place your bets.
If your aim was steady I know you wouldn't worry so bad.
Sue the minute when you
Start to worry 'bout the things you should have never said.
Why do I have to teach you?

Where's your sight?
Push a little further!
It's black and white!
Don't you want to know the answer?

Silence! Delays!
Action! Anticipate…
Slip! Climb!
Breathe! Suffocate…

You don't understand what I'm telling you anyway…
Lost in the filter (Or it stopped before it got there)
You have will what you hear,
But you can't control what you're being told!

Where's your sight?
Push a little further!
It's black and white!
Don't you want to know the answer?
Eighteen more days to understand you…

Where's your mind?
Staring through the mirror!
Kept in line
By introspective murder!

You look wet,
But I'm sure this heat will quickly make you dry!
It's diminished, are you?
You know the tricks, and you've learned 'em in the blink of an eye.
Why did I have to teach you?

Where's your sight?
Push a little further!
It's black and white!
Don't you want to know the answer?
